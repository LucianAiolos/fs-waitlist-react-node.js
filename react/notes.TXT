Still working on this error

Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND undefined
    at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:67:26) {
  errno: -3008,
  code: 'ENOTFOUND',
  syscall: 'getaddrinfo',
  hostname: 'undefined'
}

--seems to be either dns or http or local hostname related.
-- says hostname is KRAKEN

1. look up the error on google
2. try to set host name
